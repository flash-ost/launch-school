Problem 18
Create a function that takes a list of integers as an argument. Determine and return the index N for which all numbers with an index less than N sum to the same value as the numbers with an index greater than N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

If you are given a list with multiple answers, return the index with the smallest value.

The sum of the numbers to the left of index 0 is 0. Likewise, the sum of the numbers to the right of the last element is 0.

Examples
print(equal_sum_index([1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2]) == 3)
print(equal_sum_index([7, 99, 51, -48, 0, 4]) == 1)
print(equal_sum_index([17, 20, 5, -60, 10, 25]) == 0)
print(equal_sum_index([0, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2]) == -1)

# The following test case could return 0 or 3. Since we're
# supposed to return the smallest correct index, the correct
# return value is 0.
print(equal_sum_index([0, 20, 10, -60, 5, 25]) == 0)
The above tests should each print True.
