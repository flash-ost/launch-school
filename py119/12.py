Problem 12
Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns True if the string is a pangram, False if it is not.

Pangrams are sentences that contain every letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed." is a pangram since it uses every letter at least once. Note that case is irrelevant.

Examples
print(is_pangram('The quick, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!') == True)
print(is_pangram('The slow, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!') == False)
print(is_pangram("A wizard’s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog.") == True)
print(is_pangram("A wizard’s task is to vex chumps quickly in fog.") == False)
print(is_pangram("A wizard’s job is to vex chumps quickly in golf.") == True)

my_str = 'Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag.'
print(is_pangram(my_str) == True)
The above tests should each print True.

# Input: string

# Algorithm
# Initialize empty set letters
# Iterate over chars in input string:
#   if char is alphabetical:
#       add lowercase version of this char to letters set
# return True if length of letters set is 26, else False
