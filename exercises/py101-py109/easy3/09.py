Clean up the words
Given a string that consists of some words and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters, write a function that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, you should only have one space in the result (i.e., the result string should never have consecutive spaces).

Example
print(clean_up("---what's my +*& line?") == " what s my line ")
# True

        if char.isalpha():
