Egyptian Fractions
A Rational Number is any number that can be represented as the result of the division between two integers, e.g., 1/3, 3/2, 22/7, etc. The number to the left is called the numerator, and the number to the right is called the denominator.

A Unit Fraction is a rational number where the numerator is 1.

An Egyptian Fraction is the sum of a series of distinct unit fractions (no two are the same), such as:

1   1    1    1
- + - + -- + --
2   3   13   15
Every positive rational number can be written as an Egyptian fraction. For example:

    1   1   1   1
2 = - + - + - + -
    1   2   3   6
Write two functions: one that takes a Rational number as an argument, and returns a list of the denominators that are part of an Egyptian Fraction representation of the number, and another that takes a list of numbers in the same format, and calculates the resulting Rational number. You will need to use the Fraction class provided by the fractions module.

Examples
from fractions import Fraction

# Using the egyptian function
# Your results may differ for these first 3 examples
print(egyptian(Fraction(2, 1)))      # [1, 2, 3, 6]
print(egyptian(Fraction(137, 60)))   # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(egyptian(Fraction(3, 1)))
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 230, 57960]

# Using the unegyptian function
# All of these examples should print True
print(unegyptian(egyptian(Fraction(1, 2))) == Fraction(1, 2))
print(unegyptian(egyptian(Fraction(3, 4))) == Fraction(3, 4))
print(unegyptian(egyptian(Fraction(39, 20))) == Fraction(39, 20))
print(unegyptian(egyptian(Fraction(127, 130))) == Fraction(127, 130))
print(unegyptian(egyptian(Fraction(5, 7))) == Fraction(5, 7))
print(unegyptian(egyptian(Fraction(1, 1))) == Fraction(1, 1))
print(unegyptian(egyptian(Fraction(2, 1))) == Fraction(2, 1))
print(unegyptian(egyptian(Fraction(3, 1))) == Fraction(3, 1))

## Egyptian
# Input: Fraction class instance

## Algorithm
# Create empty list denominators
# Initialize denominator to 1
# while input fraction is not 0:
#   if input fraction - (1/denominator) is greater or equal to 0:
#       add denominator to list
#       subtract (1/denominator) from fraction
#   increment denominator by 1
# return denominators list
